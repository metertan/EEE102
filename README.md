I created this project for my EEE 102 Introduction to Digital Circuit Design course. I will revisit to make sure that the project is more understandable in the future. You can contact me if you have any questions about the project through www.linkedin.com/in/mete-ertan-6b76b41b4.

# EEE102 Project Description

My term project consists of a sensor complex that determines where the target is, a launcher capable of firing some non-harmful projectiles, multiple servos which will change the angle of the turret and the launcher, and a designed plastic skeleton to hold the system together. The design will have two switchable functions, it will able to function both automatically and manually.

# DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS
I designed a turret defense system that will have two mods, can find and shoot the target if some proximity limit is satisfied or the turret can be manually fully controlled, that the weapon can be rotated and can shoot via the buttons. I used one Ultrasonic Distance Sensor to detect the targetâ€™s# proximity the 7-segment display will display that distance, two servo motors for rotation in x and y axis and two more servo motors to pull the trigger. I used BASYS 3 and wrote the necessary codes in VHDL via Vivado.

# USED EXTERNAL COMPONENTS:
BASYS3 FPGA board, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, a projectile launcher, 2 SG90 servo motors, 2 SG5010 servo motors and personally-designed plastic parts that the automatic turret rest on. You can find the the designs of the plastic parts at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14mcQrY8NuZLoKoT_9vVr8aDA02-YiZgJ.
